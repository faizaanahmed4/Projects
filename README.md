# Digital Forensics Project Series

This repository contains PDF reports from a series of digital forensics labs completed as part of my cybersecurity coursework. These projects demonstrate my skills in disk imaging, memory analysis, crash dump analysis, and forensic investigation.

## My Contributions
- Conducted digital forensic investigations using tools like Autopsy and memory acquisition tools.
- Documented findings and methodology in detailed project reports.
- Analyzed disk integrity, RAM, and steganography scenarios using real-world scenarios.
